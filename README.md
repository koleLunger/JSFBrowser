#JSFBrowser [v0.1.0]

Uses the "JSFDB API" to search and view players and fighters in the JSFighter Online Database (JSFDB)

JSFBrowser is written in [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/), using [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and [PUG templating engine](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html).

Can currently:

- List all players
- List all fighters
- List all fighters that belong to a player
- Create new fighters

Look, I said it did it. Not did it well.
